                I'm Cath -- a barista from Ohio.
            <dd>
                I have two cats and I collect New Age music cassette tapes. I speak native English, decent Japanese, and, unfortunately, quite poor Spanish.

            <strong>What is this?</strong>
            <dd>
                This is my website! You probably found it on one of my elusive business cards. I hope you enjoy looking around.

            <strong>What does that Japanese text at the top say?</strong>
            <dd>
                The Japanese text in the header says <em>funamushi meishi</em>, or "wharf roach business card," so-called because I like to hide my business cards with my website link in umbrageous and curious places -- just like <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A0%E3%82%B7">wharf roaches.</a>

            <strong>What are those strings of characters at the bottom of the page?</strong>
            <dd>
                Those are my Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum addresses, respectively. You can click the hyperlinks on their abbreviated names to learn more about each one. If you want to send me money for whatever reason, you can do so with those addresses.

            <dd>
                I have a few pages under construction right now. I also have some more ideas for additional pages. For example, I'd like to archive some of my favorite New Age tapes on here. But that's for another day.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Maybe I'll build an RSS feed. &#128579 Please keep visiting or sending me annoying emails until then.

            <strong>Where do you typically leave your business cards?</strong>
            <dd>
                Dive bar restrooms, coffee shop bulletin boards, inside weird objects at thrift shops, inside books and magazines, etc.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Basically wherever I think interesting people will find them.

            <strong>Why does this website exist?</strong>
            <dd>
                I built it to connect with people around the world. It's also a fun exercise in HTML and CSS. Additionally, I think it's important to extricate one's online identity from social media companies, who sell our information to third parties. Therefore, I built a website, so I could manage my own "social medium." I hope it inspires other people to do the same, so that one day we'll all have precious Rolodexes of our dear friends' <em>funamushi meishi</em>.
